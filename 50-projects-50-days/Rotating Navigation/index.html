                        spine, drool-inducing Thiebaud cover, and declarative title. The story begins with Marguerite, our
                        teenage heroine, explaining the finer things in life. She’s learned from the best, her exacting
                        maman. At seven, Marguerite begins to play bridge – “one cannot always assume that a child can be
                        kept out of sight” – and her mother’s friends soon request Marguerite as a partner, “especially if
                        there were to be interesting stakes.” But then, at 17, Marguerite learns something her maman had
                        failed to mention, and it’s way higher stakes than what hotel to visit in Paris.</p>
